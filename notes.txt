The most structure is <html> </html>. All the content (visible and not)
will go in html tag.

You have two sections in the html tag:
    - Head (invisible, but this is where you put
      information about the website)
    - Body (this is the visible portion of the website)
        - Footer (where you put things like contacts
          or copyright)

Then, the main section of the visible part of the website has to
come in between the <main> and </main? tags. You can have elements
like paragraphs (p),headers of various sizes (h1, h2, etc.), links
(a), lists (ul for unordered and ol for ordered) (within lists you
have list items (li)), images (img src=), and importantly, you can
group them together in order to make styling easier with
<div> </div>s!

TODO:
  - Definitely change fonts for nav bar and website.
  - Make a mood board?
  - Touch up navbar:
       - Spacing
  - Figure out how to display pictures
  - Figure out how to keep nav bar at the top even when you scroll down
  - Figure out how to make a scroll-able picture display like the one on the Kyoto 2023 Website
  - Broaden your understanding of git
  - Actually learn what JSON is
  - Wireframe the website out. What would I want the user to see first, and how to get from one page to the next?
  - Make it so that hovering over the a element for the nav buttons makes the actual text elements change color.
  - The top navigation bar doesn't compress to the screen size on mobile, but everything else does beautifully
  - Load times are incredibly slow for pictures, unusably so



You want the slide to take the shape of the image inside of it,
and the slide list to take the shape of the slide inside of it.

You could maybe do this from the top down, where you use
inline-blocks all the way down to the image?

Or you could do it top up. I say bottom down

I think for the squarespace website, everything inside of the carousel
container is locked relative to each other in size and position, and
the only thing that determines the final position would be the size
of the outer carousel
    - This might actually be wrong, because if you look at the
      size of the images themselves, they all share the same aspect
      ratio (so they're definitely being cropped, unless the
      pictures I chose happened to all have the exact same aspect
      ratio)
    - Therefore, I think what's actually happening is that there is
      a container that houses each card slide, and the image is
      fitting to that. I want this container to be the
