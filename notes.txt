The most structure is <html> </html>. All the content (visible and not)
will go in html tag.

You have two sections in the html tag:
    - Head (invisible, but this is where you put
      information about the website)
    - Body (this is the visible portion of the website)
        - Footer (where you put things like contacts
          or copyright)

Then, the main section of the visible part of the website has to
come in between the <main> and </main? tags. You can have elements
like paragraphs (p),headers of various sizes (h1, h2, etc.), links
(a), lists (ul for unordered and ol for ordered) (within lists you
have list items (li)), images (img src=), and importantly, you can
group them together in order to make styling easier with
<div> </div>s!


To do:
  - Take things out of the ul and just rely on padding to separate top buttons

- Header
    - Logo (img)
    - nav__links (ul)
        - li
            - a
        - li
            - a
        - li
            - a
    - cta (a)
