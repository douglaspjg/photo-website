The most structure is <html> </html>. All the content (visible and not)
will go in html tag.

You have two sections in the html tag:
    - Head (invisible, but this is where you put
      information about the website)
    - Body (this is the visible portion of the website)
        - Footer (where you put things like contacts
          or copyright)

Then, the main section of the visible part of the website has to
come in between the <main> and </main? tags. You can have elements
like paragraphs (p),headers of various sizes (h1, h2, etc.), links
(a), lists (ul for unordered and ol for ordered) (within lists you
have list items (li)), images (img src=), and importantly, you can
group them together in order to make styling easier with
<div> </div>s!

TODO:
  - Definitely change fonts for nav bar and website.
  - Make a mood board?
  - Touch up navbar:
       - Spacing
  - Figure out how to display pictures
  - Figure out how to keep nav bar at the top even when you scroll down
  - Figure out how to make a scroll-able picture display like the one on the Kyoto 2023 Website
  - Broaden your understanding of git
  - Actually learn what JSON is
  - Wireframe the website out. What would I want the user to see first, and how to get from one page to the next?
  - Make it so that hovering over the a element for the nav buttons makes the actual text elements change color.











  TypoSort(A) { 
    for [i = 0 to (A.length - 1)] {
      for [j = 0 to (A.length - 1)] {
        if (A[i] <= A[j]) {
          swap A[i], A[j]
        }
      }
    }
  }



  Goes through the entire array from left to right
  i = 0 {

    j = 0 {
      first_element <= first_element? {
        yes, so swap the first element with itself. This is the base case.
      }
    }

    j = 1 {
      first_element <= second_element? {
        
      }
    }

  }
