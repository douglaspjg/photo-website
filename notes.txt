The most structure is <html> </html>. All the content (visible and not)
will go in html tag.

You have two sections in the html tag:
    - Head (invisible, but this is where you put
      information about the website)
    - Body (this is the visible portion of the website)
        - Footer (where you put things like contacts
          or copyright)

Then, the main section of the visible part of the website has to
come in between the <main> and </main? tags. You can have elements
like paragraphs (p),headers of various sizes (h1, h2, etc.), links
(a), lists (ul for unordered and ol for ordered) (within lists you
have list items (li)), images (img src=), and importantly, you can
group them together in order to make styling easier with
<div> </div>s!

TODO:
  - Definitely change fonts for nav bar and website.
  - Make a mood board?
  - Touch up navbar:
       - Spacing
  - Figure out how to display pictures
  - Figure out how to keep nav bar at the top even when you scroll down
  - Figure out how to make a scroll-able picture display like the one on the Kyoto 2023 Website
  - Broaden your understanding of git
  - Actually learn what JSON is
  - Wireframe the website out. What would I want the user to see first, and how to get from one page to the next?
  - Make it so that hovering over the a element for the nav buttons makes the actual text elements change color.
  - The top navigation bar doesn't compress to the screen size on mobile, but everything else does beautifully
  - Load times are incredibly slow for pictures, unusably so
  - Give the paragrpahs section a max width
    - This is basically fully functional besides one case:
      - when zooming in, the image decides the size of slides-list,
        which then bulges out of carousel and extends the contents
        past the window after zooming into 150%.
          - Therefore, I need to find a way to make the image
            shrink when ...
              - basically, if there is overflow, I want to compress
                the contents of the container to the containers
                dimensions. 
              - but in any case, I don't like the size of 600
                in any case besides 100% zoom on a laptop, but
                am struggling to figure out how to dynamically
                size an image to fit the available dimensions
  - Now you have the nav-bar as fixed to the top of the screen.
    This causes some issues because some things are hidden
    under it (the top bits of each screen, like titles and stuff).
    Fix that



You want the slide to take the shape of the image inside of it,
and the slide list to take the shape of the slide inside of it.

You could maybe do this from the top down, where you use
inline-blocks all the way down to the image?

Or you could do it top up. I say bottom down

I think what's actually happening is that there is
a container that houses each card slide, and the image is
fitting to that with either width 100% or height 100% if it
is a portrait picture

. I want this container to be the slide list,
which I will give dimensions to. But image-and-description-container
contains slide-list, so I guess I'll give that the property that
it fits to just contain slide list and image descriptions. So here,
the only thing I need to do is convert the slide list from UL to div,
give and get rid of the li's, and then give the images width and
height 100% (which means 100% of slides list). Then, I will make the
image-and-description-section a vertical flex box, which should have
the behavior I want. The last thing I need to do is figure out how to
get the entire thing to stay centered with respect to the paragraphs
section above it.
