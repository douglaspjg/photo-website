          <h2>modernism and tradition in kyoto</h2>
        </div>

          <p>
            This summer (2023), I traveled to Kyoto with the goal of understanding
            more about how Modernism and Tradition exist there today. Across
            hundreds of years, Kyoto City has nurtured rich histories as one of
            Japan’s premodern capitals. This includes the building of castles,
            devastating fires, war, festivals, and much more. Today, these
            histories are manifest in the various well preserved areas of the city
            including the Gion, Ninenzaka/Sannenzaka, and Pontocho areas. Yet,
            history is an ongoing process and this face of Kyoto is not the only
            one that exists today; equally as significant are the early modern and
            modern histories of Kyoto. The changes that happened during this
            period can be seen visually when comparing prewar Kyoto’s landscape to
            the current day landscape. For example, when one arrives in Kyoto, it
            is most likely in or around Kyoto Station, a building known for its
            avant-garde steel and glass facade that welcomes the modern age.
            Furthermore, in recent years, the number of Kyo-machiya
            (characteristic traditional Japanese style townhouses of Kyoto) has
            been decreasing drastically, yet various groups are making efforts to
            preserve them. Japanese people and foreigners alike are investing in
            machiya, renovating and repurposing them to fit the demands of the
            present day.
          </p>
          <p>
            This got me curious about how the state of current day Kyoto might fit
            in to a history that includes today, perhaps to future historians or
            people with interest. What is Modern and what is not? What is
            tradition and what is not? Are they mutually exclusive, existing in
            two separate worlds?
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout my experience, I put together collections of photographs
            and divided them into two galleries: “Color” and “Renovated Spaces”,
            each exploring the relationship between Modernism and Tradition in
            Kyoto through a different lens. When putting together the collections
            found in the “Color” gallery, I thought about how color is used and
            regulated in Kyoto, and what this might reveal about the existence of
            Tradition and Modernism. My “Renovated Spaces” gallery is an
            exploration of spaces that are associated with tradition in Kyoto,
            particularly Machiya that have been recently renovated and repurposed.
