        <h2>modernism and tradition in kyoto</h2>

          <p>
            This summer (2023), I traveled to Kyoto with the goal of
            understanding more about how Modernism and Tradition exist there
            today. Across hundreds of years, Kyoto City has nurtured rich
            histories as one of Japan’s premodern capitals. This includes the
            building of castles, devastating fires, war, festivals, and much
            more. Today, these histories are manifest in the various well
            preserved areas of the city including the Gion,
            Ninenzaka/Sannenzaka, and Pontocho areas. Yet, history is an ongoing
            process and this face of Kyoto is not the only one that exists
            today; equally as significant are the early modern and modern
            histories of Kyoto. The changes that happened during this period can
            be seen visually when comparing prewar Kyoto’s landscape to the
            current day landscape. For example, when one arrives in Kyoto, it is
            most likely in or around Kyoto Station, a building known for its
            avant-garde steel and glass facade that welcomes the modern age.
            Furthermore, in recent years, the number of Kyo-machiya
            (characteristic traditional Japanese style townhouses of Kyoto) has
            been decreasing drastically, yet various groups are making efforts
            to preserve them. Japanese people and foreigners alike are investing
            in machiya, renovating and repurposing them to fit the demands of
            the present day.
          </p>
          <p>
            This got me curious about how the state of current day Kyoto might
            fit in to a history that includes today, perhaps to future
            historians or people with interest. What is Modern and what is not?
            What is tradition and what is not? Are they mutually exclusive,
            existing in two separate worlds?
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout my experience, I put together collections of photographs
            and divided them into two galleries: “Color” and “Renovated Spaces”,
            each exploring the relationship between Modernism and Tradition in
            Kyoto through a different lens. When putting together the
            collections found in the “Color” gallery, I thought about how color
            is used and regulated in Kyoto, and what this might reveal about the
            existence of Tradition and Modernism. My “Renovated Spaces” gallery
            is an exploration of spaces that are associated with tradition in
            Kyoto, particularly Machiya that have been recently renovated and
            repurposed.
